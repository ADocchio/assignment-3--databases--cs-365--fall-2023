* **Do not start this project until you’ve read and understood these instructions. If something is not clear, ask.**

## ❖・Introduction・❖

In assignment 2, you created a database consisting of flat tables, or relations, of passwords associated with web sites/apps. For this assignment, you’ll extend on assignment 2 by doing the following:

* Separating the content in those flat relations into separate relations;
* Establishing relationships between those relations;
* Adding key constraints;
* Drawing out the relationships between those relations using the ER model; and,
* Adding an interactive layer using HTML forms and PHP.

In essence, you’re creating an elaborate, MVC-based application of assignment 2 using a WAMP/MAMP stack.
